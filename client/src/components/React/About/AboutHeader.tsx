                                Welcome to elenchus, where we believe true understanding comes from
                                a deliberate exploration of information. Our goal is to make the process
                                of learning about a topic whether it be familar or novel, a structured and
                                insightful  process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Think of a time where you found yourself provoked by something
                                you saw online. It might be a take you saw on social media,
                                a post in a comments section, or even a statement you heard in passing.
                                All of these instances can be inflammatory, particularly when you don't know
                                a rebuttal off the top of your head.

                                Having an intellectually honest persuit of the truth is significantly easier to
                                do in a deliberate search for evidence, than the all too common comment section
                                battel royale's that seem to make up online discourse. And that, is the main idea
                                here. Not unlike the method of elenchus, we've built these tools as a means of
                                introspection into why we believe something.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We make learning a deliberate and convenient process,
                                to save you time and get to the point. We offer an in-house all-in one experience,
                                serving you straight up news and extracting the real meat of the story. Web together your entire
                                thought process and clear up the foggy lense we all too often look at the world through
                                in this digital age.
