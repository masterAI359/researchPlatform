    heading: "What kind of idea?",
    explanation: `The kind of idea we're trying to examine here should be objective. 
    For example, 'The Earth is Flat'. This is a claim that can be objectively measured, and 
    evidence can be used to weigh the merit of the claim. However, subjective claims, such as 'Mint chip ice cream tastes bad',
    is a subjective claim that is entirely determined by each person's own personal taste. We can't provide data or reporting that
    would be sufficient evidence.`,
}];


const Step2Help: Help[] = [{
    heading: "Why is this important?",
    explanation: `To have an honest inquiry, we must acknowledge what our personal beliefs are before we dig in.
    If we don't reflect on how we feel about a topic, or the parties involved, we're more likely to search only for 
    what would reinforce our existing belief. We may not feel good initially about what evidence we may find. But this is
    the only way to properly inform ourselves, as opposed to doing the mental gymnastics to never move from the position 
    we once held.`

const Step3Help: Help[] = [{
    heading: "What is this asking me?",
    explanation: `In this step, write down what you may have read, watched, or heard that informs your point of view 
    at the moment. Often times when we reflect on what drove us to an opinion the details can be very muddy, and we may not
    know quite as much as we thought. This can be a difficult thing to recognize, as heated as we can get when analyzing our view
    on the world around us. Just remember, the idea itself is what's under scrutiny, not you as a person. Nobody has all the answers off the top of
    their head`
}
]

const Step4Help: Help[] = [{
    heading: "Why am i measuring these?",
    explanation: `Emotional investment can drive us to seek out selective evidence and miss the big picture. As human beings we're driven to things
    that make us feel good, not necessarily finding the truth. Our level of expertise in a topic is also a good indicator of how much we're relying on
    the impressions we've formed prior as opposed to the evidence we've sifted through.`
